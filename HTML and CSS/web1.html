            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a
                 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The 
                 batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between 
                 the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, 
                 and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").</p>
